    A class for loading structured data from JSON files within a specified directory structure.
    
    This loader is designed to operate within a predefined folder hierarchy, where
    the base directory ('structured_data') contains subdirectories corresponding to different
    categories of structured data (e.g., 'art', 'history'). Each subdirectory may contain multiple
    JSON files, from which data can be loaded individually or in bulk.

        use across different environments without the need to hard-code the absolute path.
